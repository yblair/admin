# UX Developer Sr. Challenge

## The Challenge

The client has requested that you build an Admin Dashboard view to track the latest transactions in sales and revenue. You can find the Figma file with the various views and flows [here](https://www.figma.com/design/JF8Kajh77NRzE1ojlyWs62/UX-Dev-Challenge-SR).

Please deliver a complete experience using React. If you are familiar with type-checking tools like TypeScript or PropTypes, feel free to use them. You may also use a CSS-in-JS library (such as Emotion or Styled Components), SASS, or plain CSS.

All views must be responsive and display correctly on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. You will only receive a desktop mockup. On mobile, the user should be able to see as much information as possible on the screen while maintaining design coherence.

### User Requirements

Your users should be able to:

- Switch between dark and light modes
- View the optimal layout based on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Access more information about a specific transaction through a drawer, and if the transaction selected is Pending has to be the ability to Approve or Reject the transaction itself with a modal to confirm your action
- Search in the input and find the transaction mocked by the `User` if is not any value display an `EmptyState`
- Access to the `SideBar` in the normal or collapsable view, also can access to the `Messages` section with the correct EmptyState
- View the `EmptyState` of the `Order` Tab and ability to switch between tabs

### Documentation and Delivery

Upon delivery, please provide clear explanations of your decision-making process regarding the responsive design. Make sure to document your code as thoroughly as possible.

## Where to Find Everything

On the `Platform` page, you will find the `Dashboard` with the `Drawer` interaction and the empty state of the Order Tab.

On the `Component` page, you will find the specific components, and in the `Foundation` section, you will see the color palette of the light and dark mode.

## Some Tips

1. Review the designs to start planning how to approach the project. This step is essential for organizing your CSS and components to enhance reusability.
2. You can include any additional elements you consider necessary to support your solution.
3. Pay close attention to detail.
4. Remember that while JavaScript logic is still important, our main focus for this exercise is on styles and components and not paying attention to the business logic and the router. You can hard-code the data provided in `content.txt` into your components.
5. Since we emphasize styles, please refrain from using Tailwind.
6. Include all necessary accessibility labels to ensure all users can access the platform.

## Deliverables

- Complete project files that work on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge, along with project documentation. Please deliver everything through a GitHub repository.

**Have fun building!**
